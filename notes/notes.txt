To Do: 
- hovering on things gives shows more info or something like that
- remove 'unlocked' attribute from fishStats

Visibility: 
- cake slices show up before the one above it
- habitat unlocks when you buy a habitat
- wise old mage/sir frog unlocks when you buy rowboat

Check: 
- does habitat revenue work? -> make separate revenue function? 

Bugs: 
- 4th bait can show up before 3rd bait -> add condition that 3rd must be unlocked or visible before the 4th
- Buy button for fish bowl doesn't disappear after buying it
- Cake slices are available before purchasing the last fishing rod
- Vehicle section becomes visible but not the rowboat and buy button
- Sand dollar number gets pushed onto the next line when it reaches 1000 or 2000 (Kai didn't pay enough attention to what number it happened at)
