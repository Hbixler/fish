To Do: 
- should we make a different set of conditions / costs for things in a different array/object and have a toggle similar to visibility for testing purposes? 
- add permanence to vast unknown
- rebalance whole game

Bugs: 
- rates of fishing not showing up -> show up when you leave and come back to fish island
- update current storage and storage capacities on the shared info bar
- make capacities show up properly in sand dollar part of shared info bar too
- fix win page
- weird things going on with fishing for goldfish and limits
- when the frog takes your boat and sends you back to fish island, the buy button to get a new boat is not visible
