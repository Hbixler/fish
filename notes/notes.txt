If we feel like it: 
- randomize messages for each button click of the vast unknown to show effect (should be very obvious if they kept going or crashed - maybe a colour change for crashes)
- fix win page, make it prettier and better
- chicken nuggets (100) and cake slices (50, 100) cannot ever be bought in that bulk because of storage limitations
- comma in storage capacity at top right: comma disappears after buying garbage bin
- add pause buttons on fishing
- make it so you can save and continue your game
- fancy progress bar
- make space references collapsible
- make the space references visible on other pages besides fish islands
- add progress status
- takes a second to update abled vs disabled buttons when opening fish island page
- space references only show up on fish island page
