To Do: 
- add permanence to vast unknown
- rebalance whole game

- need to list the space each fish and bait take up somewhere -> maybe under nav bar as collapsible reference
- if you go over sand dollars by a fraction of a sand dollar, max out sand dollars
- add progress status
- is a goldfish to a swordfish a reasonable jump? especially considering we're still putting them in our pocket?? 

Bugs: 
- rates of fishing not showing up -> show up when you leave and come back to fish island
- fix win page
- the buttons for buying 50 and 100 cake slices never get enabled
- sell buttons should disable when you are out of sanddollar space
- fish and bait is not visible when everything is visible

If we feel like it: 
- add pause buttons on fishing 
- make it so you can save and continue your game
- fancy progress bar
