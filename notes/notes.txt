Later: 
- telling or showing you when you run out of space -> or at least showing you the fish in the inventory and the rate even if you haven't had one yet
- trash all button (to trash a whole type of fish)
- highlight where in sequence you are during vast unknown game
- randomize messages for each button click of the vast unknown to show effect (should be very obvious if they kept going or crashed - maybe a colour change for crashes)
- fix win page, make it prettier and better
- chicken nuggets (100) and cake slices (50, 100) cannot ever be bought in that bulk because of storage limitations
- comma in storage capacity at top right: comma disappears after buying garbage bin
- add pause buttons on fishing
- make it so you can save and continue your game
- make space references collapsible
- make the space references visible on other pages besides fish islands
- add progress status to fishing (fancy progress bar)
- takes a second to update enabled vs disabled buttons when opening fish island page (loads)
