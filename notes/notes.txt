To Do: 
- hovering on things shows more info or something like that
- remove 'unlocked' attribute from fishStats
- css and spacing decisions for shared info section
- add permanency to buy and sell button visibility
- css and visual decisions for habitat page

To check: 
- does habitat revenue work? -> make separate revenue function? 

Bugs: 
- Buy button for fish bowl doesn't disappear after buying it
- buy and sell buttons for 100 show as always enabled
