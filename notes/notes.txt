To Do: 
- add permanence to vast unknown
- add limits to resources (fish, resources, etc) that you can then upgrade
    - add a section to trading for this
- add win screen -> wise old mage gives you the secret to the universe
- rebalance whole game

Bugs: 
- sell buttons not toggling properly (sell 100 button available when you don't have enough fish to sell) (buy buttons do work)
