To Do: 
- add permanence to vast unknown
- rebalance whole game

- currently can get blocked if total rates add up to not an even number (have to sell before buying more baits or fishing more fish), might not be a problem if we're okay with this? 
    - I think we should find a way to make it so it's counting up for each type of fish and doesn't count towards inventory count until it's a whole fish 
        - reasoning: if you previously fished 0.75 of various fish, but didn't get bait for them, you won't ever be able to use the remaining 0.25 space and will always be 1 fish space short in your inventory
- do we want the decimal or rounded number for the total space being taken up by fish and bait? 
- need to list the space each fish and bait take up somewhere
- turn the update spans into one function and an object? 

Bugs: 
- rates of fishing not showing up -> show up when you leave and come back to fish island
- update current storage and storage capacities on the shared info bar (partially done, needs testing)
- fix win page
- weird things going on with fishing for goldfish and limits
- the buttons for buying 50 and 100 cake slices never get enabled
