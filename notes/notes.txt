To Do: 
- css and spacing decisions for shared info section
- add permanency to buy and sell button visibility
- css and visual decisions for habitat page
- add permanence to vast unknown
- buttons for buying sail should be disabled for sir frog
- come up with sassy line for sir frog to say after you kick him (line 219 of vast-unknown.js)
- add habitat info object in main.js for permanency
- re-evaluate how tooltips look (ie blocking other things? toggle to show/hide tooltips?)
- add limits to resources (fish, resources, etc) that you can then upgrade
    - add a section to trading for this

Bugs: 
- buy sail button ocassionally doesn't buy a sail
- you can get the next fish before the current fish (ex. narwhal before a whale)
    - have baits show up only after the previous one showed up too 
    - have fish and bait show up as soon as it's possible to get them? (except the first fish and the first bait)
- fishing rates aren't permanent for visibility
- sailing south as the second pattern crashes you into a rock
