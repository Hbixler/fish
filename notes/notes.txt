To Do: 
- css and spacing decisions for shared info section
    - [DONE] centre body containers
    - readjust habitat and vast unknown to look good centred
- add permanence to vast unknown
- come up with sassy line for sir frog to say after you kick him (line 219 of vast-unknown.js)
- add limits to resources (fish, resources, etc) that you can then upgrade
    - add a section to trading for this
- add win screen -> wise old mage gives you the secret to the universe
- add check on getting to old man if you have the sailboat -> tell the player that they need the sailboat

Bugs: 
- the tooltip for habitat went away after pressing some of the buttons (this is maybe potentially possibly perhaps a hailey thing)
- sell buttons not toggling properly (sell 100 button available when you don't have enough fish to sell) (buy buttons do work)
- remove weird gap at top of vast unknown page
