To Do: 
- css and spacing decisions for shared info section
- css and visual decisions for habitat page
- add permanence to vast unknown
- buttons for buying sail should be disabled for sir frog
- come up with sassy line for sir frog to say after you kick him (line 219 of vast-unknown.js)
- re-evaluate how tooltips look (ie blocking other things? toggle to show/hide tooltips?)
- add limits to resources (fish, resources, etc) that you can then upgrade
    - add a section to trading for this
- add win screen -> wise old mage gives you the secret to the universe
- add check on getting to old man if you have the sailboat -> tell the player that they need the sailboat

Bugs: 
- the tooltip for habitat went away after pressing some of the buttons (this is maybe potentially possibly perhaps a hailey thing)
- sell buttons not toggling properly (sell 100 button available when you don't have enough fish to sell) (buy buttons do work)
- not enough space for 100 button of bait trading -> maybe narrow the inventory column? 
- vehicles trading div is gone after visiting the vast unknown 
    - and the buy button is still there...
