Overall changes to make: 
- make buttons and text only appear when you can use them/you get far enough in the game -> but also maybe push this off for as long as possible because it's harddddddd
    - [DONE] inventory
    - [DONE] habitat
    - [DONE] trading
    - [DONE] Change so bait for whale and whale displays don't show up until after bait for shark and shark displays have shown up
    - bulk buy buttons only to show up when previous number has been used (bought 1, now 5 shows up, then 10, etc)
    - [DONE] separate js file for visibility functions
    - nav bar things
    - all pages except fish island
- habitat revenue count isn't working -> make separate revenue function
- automatic buying bait and selling fish options
- buy button enabled only when you can afford it - text gets dimmer after item is bought -> when you unlock something the buy button shows up but is not enabled
- hovering on things gives shows more info or something like that
- re-re-balance: 
    - each type of fish can be caught with one of the related baits -> bait is removed from the bait count in inventory only when the fish is caught which still takes the allotted time listed in main.js
- We need to adjust visibility now that everything is on different pages
- fishing progress
    - temporary solution: add equipment stats to right side
    - eventually add progress bars to fish on right side

Consider this:
- We need to clean up where we have functions and where we have html 
    - right now the update file has some free floating code
- also should inventory and trading still be separate? I think not if on same page but if we later put the inventory in multple pages then yes
- We need to think about our pseudo-backend and how our frontend accesses it
    - should limit access points to specific functions
- also it's not super efficient (key word @kai) to pass in the ENTIRE fishStats just to like unlock one fish
    - should only be passing in the information that is relevant really
- if we want to get really serious we can make diagrams
- in general just backend needs to be more obscured, focused, and consistent across different elements
    - think about what parts of the backend we want to change -> mainly fish counts, money, and whether things have been unlocked/equipped
    - so our functions that access the backend should only change fish counts, money, and things being unlocked/equipped
- i am being a little overdramatic we are doing an okay job of separating the two it just feels like it could be cleaner

Other things: 
- test how long it takes to win game -> perhaps less than an hour is too easy? People need to suffer to enjoy
- have other people play the game? We need beta testers
    - [DONE] Hailey's sister
    - Bully Hailey's roommates into playing clicker games
    - Kai has a willing victim/friend (possibly more)
