To Do: 
- should we make a different set of conditions / costs for things in a different array/object and have a toggle similar to visibility for testing purposes? 
- add permanence to vast unknown
- add limits to resources (fish, resources, etc) that you can then upgrade
    - add a section to trading for this
    - to make room for this, should the inventory be in the shared info section like the fish? 
- add win screen -> wise old mage gives you the secret to the universe
- rebalance whole game

Bugs: 
- sell buttons not toggling properly (sell 100 button available when you don't have enough fish to sell) (buy buttons do work)
- if you go through by sailing north and then kicking the frog and punching the frog, the rowboat goes away but you can still sail south afterwards
- you can buy a sail without a sailboat
    - should the frog send you back to fish island if you lose your rowboat? (maybe the dialogue with a button that you have to click that sends you back?)
