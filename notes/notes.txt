Overall changes to make: 
- make buttons and text only appear when you can use them/you get far enough in the game -> but also maybe push this off for as long as possible because it's harddddddd
    - [DONE] inventory
    - [DONE] habitat
    - [DONE] trading
    - [DONE] Change so bait for whale and whale displays don't show up until after bait for shark and shark displays have shown up
    - bulk buy buttons only to show up when previous number has been used (bought 1, now 5 shows up, then 10, etc)
    - [DONE] separate js file for visibility functions
    - nav bar things
    - all pages except fish island
- automatic buying bait and selling fish options
- buy button enabled only when you can afford it - text gets dimmer after item is bought -> when you unlock something the buy button shows up but is not enabled
- we should do it so that our code automatically populates the list for fish/bait/upgradables -> that way we can easily add a new item in main.js without messing with the html
- hovering on things gives shows more info or something like that
- re-re-balance: 
    - each type of fish can be caught with one of the related baits -> bait is removed from the bait count in inventory only when the fish is caught which still takes the allotted time listed in main.js
- have right side shared info section be coded in javascript

Consider this:
- We need to clean up where we have functions and where we have html 
    - right now the update file has some free floating code
- also should inventory and trading still be separate? I think not if on same page but if we later put the inventory in multple pages then yes
- We need to think about our pseudo-backend and how our frontend accesses it
    - should limit access points to specific functions
- also it's not super efficient (key word @kai) to pass in the ENTIRE fishStats just to like unlock one fish
    - should only be passing in the information that is relevant really
- if we want to get really serious we can make diagrams
- in general just backend needs to be more obscured, focused, and consistent across different elements
    - think about what parts of the backend we want to change -> mainly fish counts, money, and whether things have been unlocked/equipped
    - so our functions that access the backend should only change fish counts, money, and things being unlocked/equipped
- i am being a little overdramatic we are doing an okay job of separating the two it just feels like it could be cleaner

Other things: 
- test how long it takes to win game -> perhaps less than an hour is too easy? People need to suffer to enjoy
- have other people play the game? We need beta testers
    - [DONE] Hailey's sister
    - Bully Hailey's roommates into playing clicker games
    - Kai has a willing victim/friend
- [DONE] Kai should correct Hailey's attempt at french -> she just spanished all the words/conjugations she didn't know

Highest priority: 
- [DONE] keep Kai from dying -> Kai needs to step it up -> Kai coughs less than three times per session
- [DONE] Kai needs to unbruise his rib -> can breathe and laugh without dying
- [DONE] make it so Hailey doesn't have to go into the CSS file literally every coding session -> Hailey goes into the css section less than 50% of the time

Changes done: 
- [DONE] make east and west buttons closer to reset button
- [DONE] move total sand dollar count and other universal information to the right side of everything
- [DONE] dynamic nav bar in js 
- [DONE] remove habitat from main page
- [DONE] adjust rates and costs
    - [DONE] if you have a better fishing rod, you lose 4 SD whenever you get a swordfish... that's unfortunate...
    - [DONE] if you have an even better fishing rod, you break even when you get a shark... still seems like a waste of time...
    - [DONE] make bait cheaper -> even though Hailey is gonna get a rowboat
    - [DONE]  What kind of economic system is this where you spend 1500 to get a narwhal and only sell the narwhal for 30?????????
- [DONE] add "Small Lake" to list of habitats
- [DONE] add results to buying rowboat so Hailey feels satisfied when she wins the game... whoops
    - [DONE] make button to buy subtract the SDs from the count
- [DONE] bulk buying and selling bait and fish in the trading section -> clicker game doesn't need to mean clicking every 0.05 seconds
- [DONE] make the habitat fun line change so that it doesn't lie to you -> fish are not always swimming happily in your bowl. Sometimes there are no fish. Sometimes it's a tank, not a bowl. Sometimes, the fish are very unhappy. You never know. Bad to assume. 
- [DONE] put space between text and buy/sell buttons because it's driving Kai's eyes crazy
- [DONE] Goldfish count starts out as NaN (lovely)
- [DONE] Currently when you are at your habitat you are not currently fishing -> similarly, not generating revenue while on fish island
- [DONE] CSS things
    - [DONE] align titles with boxes
    - [DONE] fish button shifts after you fish for the first time and the inventory box appears
- [DONE] have other vehicles and better oceans to go to -> lame that a rowboat takes you nowhere... 
- [DONE] move set functions into update functions
- [DONE] organize files into folders
- [DONE] split current into inventory/habitat page and trading page
- [DONE] functions for updating message
    - [DONE] updateMessage as function to be done externally and called into other functions
- [DONE] fix buyvehicle function
