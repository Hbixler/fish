To Do: 
- hovering on things shows more info or something like that
- remove 'unlocked' attribute from fishStats
- fix habitat visibility (add fish in habitat as list to the visibility object and switch is and make them visible functions to overall functions)
- css and spacing decisions for shared info section
- add permanency to buy and sell button visibility

To check: 
- does habitat revenue work? -> make separate revenue function? 

Bugs: 
- 4th bait can show up before 3rd bait -> add condition that 3rd must be unlocked or visible before the 4th
- Buy button for fish bowl doesn't disappear after buying it
- Cake slices are available before purchasing the last fishing rod
- buy and sell buttons for 100 always enable
