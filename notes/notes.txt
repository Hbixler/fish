To Do: 
- should we make a different set of conditions / costs for things in a different array/object and have a toggle similar to visibility for testing purposes? 
- add permanence to vast unknown
- add limits to resources (fish, resources, etc) that you can then upgrade
    - add a section to trading for this
    - to make room for this, should the inventory be in the shared info section like the fish? 
- add win screen -> wise old mage gives you the secret to the universe
- rebalance whole game

Bugs: 
- rates of fishing not showing up -> show up when you leave and come back to fish island
- when the frog takes your boat and sends you back to fish island, the buy button to get a new boat is not visible
