To Do: 
- hovering on things gives shows more info or something like that
- remove 'unlocked' attribute from fishStats

Visibility: 
- cake slices show up before the one above it
- habitat unlocks when you buy a habitat
- wise old mage/sir frog unlocks when you buy rowboat

Check: 
- does habitat revenue work? -> make separate revenue function?
