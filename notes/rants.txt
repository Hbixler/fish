Hello friends,
Why did CSS have to be my child? I would like to officially return my child for a nice easy docile child. Why are all of Kai's children so well-behaved? Surely this is a child issue and not at all representative of parenting styles.
Insincerely,
Hailey

Hailey is time traveling

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
ദ്ദി( ˶^ᗜ^˶ )
P.S. Hailey doesn't know what day it is...

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
No comeback, I see... 

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
Hailey values intelligence in a partner even more than Kai, and yet she does this?? 

09/06/2024 - Hailey:
Oakae ai wehll

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
Hailey should just make up new ways to spell every word and then try to find someone intelligent to date that she can teach her new writing system to

09/06/2024 - Hailey:
I guess some of us are trendsetters and some of us are followers.

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
There are two ways to spell this word and Hailey has invented a third? 

09/06/2024 - Hailey:
(Kai claims he wants to date someone with intelligence but can't even spell??)

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
Hailey is right. Kai is not a very hounourable person, but he is an honourable person :P

09/06/2024 - Hailey:
Kai is not a very hounourable person :(

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
No comeback, I see...

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
It hurts my soul when Hailey thinks that the right ways to spell things are atrocities. They are in fact simply correct.

09/06/2024 - Hailey:
It hurts my soul when Kai approves of atrocities to the English language ):

09/06/2024 - Kai: 
It hurts my soul to spell honoUrable hoUnoUrable. So yeah... no. @Hailey

07/22/2024 - Kai: 
Note to self: don't go another 6 years without writing a do while loop. You WILL forget how to do it.

07/22/2024 - Hailey:
Dear hover box,
Please stop flashing me. 
Sincerely,
Hailey

07/20/2024 - Kai: 
Why is the bait visibility such a mess? There are 3 versions of visibility strategies... and some variables that aren't used. Guess we're just revamping the whole thing. Wish me luck... I'm probably going to want to scream... a lot. 
^^ Sorry for not raising my child well - Hailey 08/08/2024

07/18/2024 - Kai and Hailey: 
Why won't live share work? How offensive! 

07/08/2024 - Kai: 
Dear misbehaving fish, 
I am trying to make your list visibility permanent. There are no error messages, and it is visible according to the array in main.js. I have logged everything I can think of to the console, and all I can tell is that it should work... So what else am I supposed to do? 
Sincerely, 
Prepared to yell at fish to make it work

07/07/2024 - Hailey: 
Please kindly start doing the things that you are supposed to do
