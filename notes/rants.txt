Dear hover box,
Please stop flashing me. 
Sincerely,

Why won't live share work? How rude!

Dear misbehaving fish, 
I am trying to make your list visibility permanent. There are no error messages, and it is visible according to the array in main.js. I have logged everything I can think of to the console, and all I can tell is that it should work... So what else am I supposed to do? 
Sincerely, 
Prepared to yell at fish to make it work

Please kindly start doing the things that you are supposed to do
